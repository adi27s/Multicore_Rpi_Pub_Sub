This model incorporates the Raspberry Pi 4 as the central processing unit, effectively leveraging its four cores to monitor the reservoir level and manage gate control. The gate control system offers both manual and automatic operation modes. In the manual mode, a client system, connected to the server via the internet (which is facilitated by the Raspberry Pi), assumes control. The automatic mode relies on an ultrasonic sensor to gather water level information, ensuring the prevention of flooding incidents.
